## Technologies Used

### Frontend: JavaScript
The frontend of this project is built using **JavaScript**, a versatile and powerful language that is widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. JavaScript enables the website to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring smooth interactions and real-time updates on the client-side.

### Backend: Python
The backend of the project is powered by **Python**, a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is used to handle server-side logic, manage data processing, and communicate between the frontend and the database. It offers strong support for backend frameworks, making development efficient and scalable.

### Database: SQLite
**SQLite** is used as the database for this project. It is a lightweight, self-contained, and serverless database engine that stores data in a single file. SQLite is ideal for applications where simplicity, low setup overhead, and minimal administration are priorities, making it a great choice for this projectâ€™s database management needs.
